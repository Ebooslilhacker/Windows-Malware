This is a Software that I have programmed for the study of a series of viruses.

The tool has a graphical interface that is very simple to use in which you only have to select the virus you want and it will automatically create it for you.

The tool in the comments and the names of the viruses is in English so if you don't have much idea what it says please translate it otherwise you will have difficulties using the program.

Next, the tool has a total of 10 viruses, each of which has a certain type of range in terms of dangerousness when handling your computer.

The order is Harmless >> Troll >> Annoying >> Dangerous >> and Deadly.

Finally, I am NOT responsible for what you do with these Malwares, the use of the tool is your decision...
